**Status:** ✅ **v0.14.0 "Markup Tools" shipped** — the GUI tranche's **R3 (M56–M60) is complete**,
and because the **v0.13.0 tag was cut but never published** (owner call), this release also delivers
**R2 "Document Hygiene" (M51–M54)** to users: extract / insert-blank / duplicate pages, **Reduced
Size** export, document **Properties + metadata** editing (both stores), and **AES-256** password
protection. R3 itself is the markup kit: **underline & strikeout** on Highlight's text-quad path,
a **pen** plus **lines / arrows / rectangles / ellipses**, a shared **colour · width · opacity ·
fill** picker with curated per-verb text-markup palettes, and full **object editing** — marquee and
Ctrl-click multi-select, move, **resize** (single + group, about the bounding box), **z-order**
(Bring to Front / Send to Back, which is both paint *and* hit order), and group **copy / cut /
paste** that preserves the arrangement. Everything bakes into the saved PDF and reopens editable.
Four fixes came out of owner testing and shipped in the same tranche: re-marking text now **merges**
into the existing mark instead of stacking a second layer ([#139](https://github.com/utyagi24/klarpdf/pull/139)),
mark paint order in the preview now follows the model's z-order rather than the mark's *type* — so a
filled shape hides a text box exactly as it does in the saved file ([#140](https://github.com/utyagi24/klarpdf/pull/140)),
group copy/paste reversed an earlier deferral ([#141](https://github.com/utyagi24/klarpdf/pull/141)),
and the toolbar's dropdown arrows share one position ([#142](https://github.com/utyagi24/klarpdf/pull/142)).
Release: <https://github.com/utyagi24/klarpdf/releases/tag/v0.14.0>. 737 headless tests green
(1 expected skip — the Poppler `pdftotext` cross-check, absent on Windows).

**v0.12.0 "Navigate & Polish"** — the GUI tranche's **R1 (M45–M50)**. **Outline sidebar**: a document with bookmarks gets a Pages | Outline switcher (no
TOC → no tab and no tab bar, owner rule) showing the **live** `remapped_toc()` tree — follows
edits, tracks scroll, click-to-jump — plus **Go to Page…** (Ctrl+G)
([#117](https://github.com/utyagi24/klarpdf/pull/117)). **Context menus everywhere**, hit-test
routed — selection / internal link / **external link (Copy Link Address)** / annotation / bare
page / sidebar ([#118](https://github.com/utyagi24/klarpdf/pull/118)). **Search-all results
panel** — List All shows page + context-snippet rows, click-to-jump; the surface M64 reuses
([#119](https://github.com/utyagi24/klarpdf/pull/119)). **Crop pages** — `crop_override` rides the
PageRef like rotation; page/selected/all scopes; *hidden, not removed*; Remove Crop restores the
full MediaBox even for pre-cropped files ([#120](https://github.com/utyagi24/klarpdf/pull/120)).
**Night reading mode** — view-only inversion; file/print/export stay true-colour
([#121](https://github.com/utyagi24/klarpdf/pull/121)). **The Tools menu** — modes out of View,
Rotate into Edit beside the page ops ([#123](https://github.com/utyagi24/klarpdf/pull/123)).
Review-testing fixes folded in: toolbar text tools **apply to a live selection** (Preview-style);
the find bar **revives its kept query** on reopen; the sidebar keeps its width bounds with the
switcher mounted; two offscreen-suite deadlock classes fixed (stale-watcher zombie prompts; a
conftest guard that fails loudly on any unexpected modal); and a **save-fidelity fix** — URI links
PyMuPDF's `insert_pdf` silently drops (unbalanced-paren URIs, seen in the wild) are restored at
materialise ([#122](https://github.com/utyagi24/klarpdf/pull/122)). **v0.11.0 stays reserved for
the MCP / Agent Bridge** (owner decision, PR #116) — hence R1 = v0.12.0. 485 headless tests green.

**v0.10.1** — a patch fixing the Windows shell integration v0.10.0 got wrong.
**The app icon is now a tile.** The brand mark is a portrait page, so it spanned only **59%** of the
square canvas Windows gives an icon (24×24 for the taskbar) — against 82–100% for every other app on a
typical machine — and read as *tiny*. `ui/icons/klarpdf.svg` is a gradient rounded square that spans
100%. **`.pdf` files get their own icon**: the ProgID `DefaultIcon` pointed at `klarpdf.exe,0`, so
every PDF on disk wore the *application's* icon; a new `klarpdf-doc.ico` (from the brand's
`pdf-file-icon.svg`, drawn for this and never wired up) now shows a page. The free-standing mark
survives in the About dialog. And **Setup and the uninstaller now refuse to run while KlarPDF is
open** — the app holds a named mutex Inno watches (`AppMutex`). Without it, uninstalling a running app
left the install directory behind (Windows won't delete a running `.exe`) and *recreated*
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\klarpdf`, because the dying process rewrites `view_state.json` on shutdown. It refuses
rather than force-closes: KlarPDF prompts on unsaved edits, and Restart Manager would bypass that
prompt.

**v0.10.0** — **"KlarPDF"**, the rebrand + open-source release. The app formerly
built as `pdfproj` is now **KlarPDF** (*klar* = "clear"): new name, new mark and toolbar glyph set, a
root **AGPL-3.0-or-later `LICENSE`** + `THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES`, and a **Help menu** — About (version,
licence, no-warranty notice, a link to the source at *this exact tag*) and Open-Source Licenses (the
bundled texts, offline). Community-health files and a governance policy landed too: issues are open to
everyone, pull requests are restricted to the maintainer and invited collaborators. Windows-facing
consequences of the rename: a **fresh Inno `AppId`**, so `klarpdf-setup.exe` installs as a *new* app —
**uninstall `pdfproj` first** (`RELEASE.md`) — a `KlarPDF.Document` ProgID, `%LOCALAPPDATA%\klarpdf`
for settings, and the exes finally carry **version metadata** (`ProductName`/`FileVersion`), which the
spec had never set. Milestones **M0–M38 complete** (v0.1.0 = M0–M9,
v0.2.0 = M10–M15, v0.3.0 = M16–M19, v0.4.0 = M20–M22, v0.5.0 = M23–M26, v0.6.0 = M27–M30,
v0.7.0 = M31 + M31.5 + M34, v0.8.0 = M35–M37, v0.9.0 = M32 + M33 + M38). Releases:

<https://github.com/utyagi24/pdfproj/releases/tag/v0.9.1> ·
<https://github.com/utyagi24/pdfproj/releases/tag/v0.9.0>. **v0.9.6** is a bug-fix patch: the **Pages
sidebar thumbnails no longer flicker** at the window height where the bottom edge meets the last
thumbnail — the thumbnail is sized off a scrollbar-invariant width, so the vertical scrollbar toggling
on/off can no longer drive a resize→scrollbar→resize loop
([#87](https://github.com/utyagi24/pdfproj/pull/87)); and **a second PDF opened from Explorer now comes
to the front** (previously only the first did) — the forwarding launch hands its foreground right to the
resident instance via `AllowSetForegroundWindow`, which Windows otherwise denies a background process
([#88](https://github.com/utyagi24/pdfproj/pull/88)). **v0.9.5** is a viewer-polish patch: the page
opens **centred** and stays centred, and **Fit Width / Fit Page are sticky on resize**
([#80](https://github.com/utyagi24/pdfproj/pull/80)); the **Pages sidebar** gets a narrower default
with a centred single column whose thumbnails **scale with the sidebar width** (Preview-style, capped);
a **rotated page that's wider than the view is centred** on fit; and the **Highlight** and
**Redact-Text** tools now **preview the armed selection in their final colour** (highlight colour /
redaction black) while you drag ([#81](https://github.com/utyagi24/pdfproj/pull/81)). **v0.9.4** is a dependency security patch:
bump **pypdf 6.13.2 → 6.13.3**, clearing GHSA-jm82-fx9c-mx94 (Moderate memory-DoS in the `pypdf`
fallback edit engine; no functional change). **v0.9.3** is an open-behavior patch
([#66](https://github.com/utyagi24/pdfproj/pull/66)): a new window opens **on the monitor under the
cursor** (where you double-clicked in Explorer) instead of always the primary; the **open-from-Explorer
flicker is gone** — `activate_window` now raises the window with a `SetWindowPos` z-order nudge instead
of toggling the `WindowStaysOnTopHint` flag (changing a window flag recreates the native window on
Windows → a visible flash every raise); and the **Pages sidebar is hidden by default**, remembered
app-wide, for a clean fast open. **v0.9.2** was a load-time / UX patch:
the open render/zoom **flicker is gone** (the page renders once at Fit Page, at the final geometry, instead of
being re-sized/re-zoomed after the window is already visible — [#63](https://github.com/utyagi24/pdfproj/pull/63)),
and the **Pages sidebar renders thumbnails lazily** (only the pages scrolled into view, not every
page up front), so large documents open far faster — a 320-page doc went ~1010 ms → ~150 ms
([#64](https://github.com/utyagi24/pdfproj/pull/64)). **v0.9.1** was a UX patch: a document window
opens at the **full screen height, centred horizontally, at Fit Page**
([#61](https://github.com/utyagi24/pdfproj/pull/61)). v0.9.0 "Encrypted & Links" adds
**encrypted / password-protected PDFs** (prompt + `authenticate` on open, then the source is held
decrypted so the output stays unencrypted) and **internal links** — `links_remap` rebuilds GoTo
**and** named-destination links at materialize so reorder/delete/Save keeps them working, and the
viewer makes them **clickable** (click → jump to the target page; `viewer/links.py`). **v0.8.1** was
a bug-fix patch: double-click open from a case-sensitive `\\wsl.localhost\` / UNC folder works for
every file ([#55](https://github.com/utyagi24/pdfproj/pull/55)). v0.8.0 "Images" adds **image import**
(drag a local PNG/JPEG/… from Explorer onto the Pages sidebar → it inserts as a page, converted via
PyMuPDF `convert_to_pdf`) and **image export** (`File ▸ Export ▸ Image…`; selected page(s) → PNG/JPEG
at a chosen DPI, edits-aware off `render_output`), plus UI polish (clearer multi-page selection,
vertical-centred fitting page, centred text-box text). v0.7.0 "Round-trip & Export" adds
**annotation round-trip editing** (reopen a saved doc → move / edit / remove our author-tagged
highlights & text boxes; the page render strips our baked marks so the editable overlay is the single
source of truth, and text selection reads that stripped page) and a flatten **Export → PDF**
(`File ▸ Export`; bakes annotations + form widgets into page content via `Document.bake()`,
text-preserving — a locked counterpart to the round-trip). v0.6.0 "Rich Text & Live Preview" adds
**styled text boxes**, **live thumbnails**, and **dynamic theme icons**. v0.5.0 "File Safety & Output"
adds **Revert to Saved**, an **external-change warning**, and **edits-aware printing**. v0.4.0
"Annotate & Redact" adds text **highlight** + **text boxes** and **true destructive redaction**.
**R2 "Document Hygiene" (M51–M54) is merged and tagged `v0.13.0` — no published release** (owner
call, 2026-07-19): the owner validated the merged build directly and skipped M55's release cut;
R2's features first *ship* with the next published release. **Next:** two planned roadmaps —
**v0.11.0 "MCP / Agent Bridge"** (M39–M44; `PLAN.md` §MCP / Agent Bridge roadmap; the version
number stays reserved for it) and the **GUI feature tranche's remaining releases R3–R5**
(M56–M70; `PLAN.md` §GUI feature roadmap — next tranche milestone is **M56**; sequencing vs the
bridge stays the owner's call). Other deferred items live in `PLAN.md` §Future enhancements.
**Open follow-ups** (carried items) are at the bottom.

**v0.2.0 ✅ — "Polish, Print & Forms"** (shipped)

- [x] **M10** Icons — app `.ico` + toolbar icons (undo/redo, zoom, cut/copy/paste) — *WSLg + Windows (frozen-exe icon)* — [#18](https://github.com/utyagi24/pdfproj/pull/18) (frozen-exe icon validated at M15)

- [x] **M14** ⭐ Page-edit layer + form filling (fill existing AcroForm fields) — *WSL (model+tests) + WSLg* — [#24](https://github.com/utyagi24/pdfproj/pull/24) (model foundation) + [#25](https://github.com/utyagi24/pdfproj/pull/25) (inline fill)

**v0.3.0 ✅ — "Interaction & Drag-and-Drop"** (shipped)

- [x] **M16** Drag visuals — page-thumbnail drag pixmap (+ "N pages" badge) + custom drop-insertion marker — *WSLg* — [#28](https://github.com/utyagi24/pdfproj/pull/28)
- [x] **M17** Explorer file drop — drag a `.pdf` from Explorer onto the Pages panel → insert at the drop slot — *WSL (logic) + WSLg* — [#29](https://github.com/utyagi24/pdfproj/pull/29)
- [x] **M18** Grab / Select mode — hand/pan vs text-selection toggle (default Select), toolbar + View menu — *WSLg* — [#30](https://github.com/utyagi24/pdfproj/pull/30)
- [x] **M19** Verify + release → tag **v0.3.0** — *Windows* — [#31](https://github.com/utyagi24/pdfproj/pull/31)

**v0.4.0 ✅ — "Annotate & Redact"** (keystone release, shipped)

- [x] **M20** ⭐ Annotations — text highlight + text-box (free-text) on the M14 layer — *WSL + WSLg* — [#32](https://github.com/utyagi24/pdfproj/pull/32) (per-page model) + [#33](https://github.com/utyagi24/pdfproj/pull/33) (viewer highlight/text-box interaction)
- [x] **M21** ⭐ Redaction — true destructive `apply_redactions` + leak verification (`fitz` + Poppler `pdftotext` cross-engine). Two entry points, one multi-rect `Redaction` descriptor: **Redact Region** (one-shot rubber-band, for images/logos) + **Redact Selection** (text-flow, one continuous bar per line). A redacted **Save is a point of no return** (confirm → write clean → reload from clean file → clear undo: secret gone from disk *and* RAM). Bundled text-box UX polish (one-shot armed inserts; drag-to-move; double-click re-edit; auto-grow W+H; clamp to page). Forward-compat hooks for future round-trip + font/size/colour picker (`TextBox.fontname`; pdfproj author-tag on baked annots). Annotate/redact tools unified as **one-shot armed** gestures (Text Box click; Highlight/Redact-Text drag-over-text — continuous bar per line; Redact-Block drag-rect), grouped together. Cross-window page drag/paste **carries per-page edits** (annotations + redactions + rotation). — *WSL (model+verify) + WSLg* — [#34](https://github.com/utyagi24/pdfproj/pull/34)
- [x] **M22** Verify + release → tag **v0.4.0** (version bump + docs; 232 headless tests green) — *Windows* — [#35](https://github.com/utyagi24/pdfproj/pull/35)

**v0.5.0 — "File Safety & Output"** (planned)

- [x] **M23** Revert / Reopen — discard all edits + reload from disk (reuse `reload_from_file` + clear undo, dirty-confirm) — *WSL + WSLg* — [#37](https://github.com/utyagi24/pdfproj/pull/37)
- [x] **M24** External-change warning — file-changed-on-disk detection (`QFileSystemWatcher` + `(mtime, size)` signature) → Reload / Keep prompt (+ Overwrite / Reload / Cancel before an overwriting Save) — *WSL (logic) + Windows* — [#38](https://github.com/utyagi24/pdfproj/pull/38)
- [x] **M25** Edits-aware printing — Print renders the same edits-applied output a Save would write (page order, rotation, form values, highlights, text boxes, redactions), so a not-yet-saved redaction no longer prints the original. Preview / "Save as PDF" / scale modes were dropped (the native dialog can't host them; a rasterised PDF is worse than Save As) — the page→image render is kept as the engine for the planned **image export** (M36). — *WSL logic; Windows print validation* — [#39](https://github.com/utyagi24/pdfproj/pull/39)
- [x] **M26** Verify + release → tag **v0.5.0** — *Windows* — [#40](https://github.com/utyagi24/pdfproj/pull/40)

**v0.6.0 ✅ — "Rich Text & Live Preview"** (shipped)

- [x] **M27** ⭐ Styled text boxes — font family/size/colour + box fill + box outline (on/off, black), via a formatting bar on the inline editor. **B/I/U + coloured outline descoped** (owner call — base-14 bold/italic variant names don't render on PyMuPDF's FreeText appearance path; they'd force the heavier richtext path). Simple `add_freetext_annot` (`text_color`/`fill_color`/`border_width`), text stays in `/Contents`. — *WSL (model+tests) + WSLg* — [#41](https://github.com/utyagi24/pdfproj/pull/41) (model) + [#42](https://github.com/utyagi24/pdfproj/pull/42) (viewer)
- [x] **M28** Live thumbnails — thumbnails reflect the page's edited state (annotations/redactions/fills), rendered from the shared `render_output` bake (only when the doc has edits; clean docs keep the fast source render) — *WSLg* — [#43](https://github.com/utyagi24/pdfproj/pull/43)
- [x] **M29** Dynamic theme icons — runtime OS light↔dark re-tint. Verify revealed it never fired: `changeEvent` matched only `ApplicationPaletteChange`, but Qt delivers `PaletteChange`; now handles both, so the toolbar glyphs re-tint live (app icon is theme-agnostic) — *WSLg + Windows* — [#44](https://github.com/utyagi24/pdfproj/pull/44)
- [x] **M30** Verify + release → tag **v0.6.0** (version bump + docs; 285 headless tests green) — *Windows* — [#45](https://github.com/utyagi24/pdfproj/pull/45)

**v0.7.0 ✅ — "Round-trip & Export"** (shipped)

- [x] **M31** ⭐ Annotation round-trip editing — reopen → move/edit/remove our author-tagged annotations (strip-then-re-add at materialize); page render + text selection read the stripped page so the editable overlay is authoritative (no double-draw / stale-position select) — *WSL (model+tests) + WSLg* — [#46](https://github.com/utyagi24/pdfproj/pull/46)
- [x] **M31.5** Export → PDF (flatten) — new **Export** action (`File ▸ Export`); bake annotations + form widgets into page content (PyMuPDF `Document.bake()`, text-preserving — locks the marks, the opposite of M31's round-trip). Extensible Export path (`model/export.py`); M36 adds an image format. — *WSL (model+tests) + WSLg* — [#48](https://github.com/utyagi24/pdfproj/pull/48)
- [x] **M34** Verify + release → tag **v0.7.0** (version bump + docs + re-scope; 317 headless tests green) — *Windows* — [#49](https://github.com/utyagi24/pdfproj/pull/49)

> Re-scope (owner, 2026-06-20): encrypted-PDF (M32) + internal-link remap (M33) moved **out of
> v0.7.0** to a new **v0.9.0**, so the image work (v0.8.0) ships next.

**v0.8.0 ✅ — "Images"** (shipped)

- [x] **M35** Image import — drag a local image (jpg/png/…) from Explorer onto the Pages sidebar → insert as a new page (reuse M17 drop + PyMuPDF `convert_to_pdf`) — *WSL (logic) + WSLg* — [#50](https://github.com/utyagi24/pdfproj/pull/50)
- [x] **M36** Image export — **extend the M31.5 Export feature** to images: selected page(s) → PNG/JPEG at a chosen DPI (reuse M25 `render_output` + `_page_image`; edits-aware) — *WSL (render) + WSLg* — [#51](https://github.com/utyagi24/pdfproj/pull/51)
- [x] **M37** Verify + release → tag **v0.8.0** (version bump + docs; 341 headless tests green) — *Windows* — [#54](https://github.com/utyagi24/pdfproj/pull/54)

> Pre-release polish (owner, 2026-06-20): clearer multi-page selection in the sidebar + vertically
> centred fitting page ([#52](https://github.com/utyagi24/pdfproj/pull/52)) and vertically centred
> text-box text ([#53](https://github.com/utyagi24/pdfproj/pull/53)).

**v0.9.0 ✅ — "Encrypted & Links"** (shipped; re-scoped out of v0.7.0)

- [x] **M32** Encrypted / password PDFs — detect `needs_pass`, prompt, `authenticate` on open (then store the source decrypted in memory; output stays unencrypted) — *WSL + WSLg* — [#57](https://github.com/utyagi24/pdfproj/pull/57)
- [x] **M33** Internal link remap **+ navigation** — `links_remap` rebuilds GoTo **and** named-destination links at materialize (reorder/delete/Save keeps them working; named dests baked to GoTo — insert_pdf drops them entirely), **and** the viewer makes internal links clickable (click → jump to target page; pointing-hand on hover, `viewer/links.py`) — *WSL (model+tests) + WSLg* — [#58](https://github.com/utyagi24/pdfproj/pull/58)
- [x] **M38** Verify + release → tag **v0.9.0** (version bump + docs; 369 headless tests green) — *Windows* — [#59](https://github.com/utyagi24/pdfproj/pull/59)

## Roadmap — v0.11.0 "MCP / Agent Bridge" (planned)

Spec + architecture in `PLAN.md` §MCP / Agent Bridge roadmap. Same conventions: **one PR per
milestone**, tick the box here on merge. ⭐ marks the keystone (GUI-free, fully headless-testable).
A new MCP server surface (`mcp/` package) that reuses the GUI-free `model/` core **without PySide6**
and ships as a separate optional component — the `klarpdf-setup.exe` audit surface is untouched.

- [ ] **M39** ⭐ MCP scaffold + read-only core — `mcp/` FastMCP stdio server; headless query/metadata
  tools (`get_info`, `get_outline`, `search`, `extract_text`, `render_page`, `get_form_fields`); no
  PySide6 import on the server path; headless tests — *WSL*
- [ ] **M40** Transform tools — `split` / `merge` / `reorder` / `delete_pages` / `rotate` /

## Roadmap — GUI feature tranche R1–R5 (planned; M45–M70)

Spec, per-milestone scope, and the binding **design budgets** (UI / lightness / honesty) in
`PLAN.md` §GUI feature roadmap. Owner-decided **2026-07-18** (23 features approved; radio-button
groups rejected → §Future enhancements). Same conventions: **one PR per milestone**, tick here on
merge; ⭐ = keystone. **Zero new dependencies** across the tranche. Versions provisional
(v0.12.0 → v0.16.0 if the MCP bridge ships v0.11.0 first; assigned at tag time). (**R#** = release —
**G#** already belongs to the Public-Release Readiness milestones below.)

**R1 — "Navigate & Polish"** (prov. v0.12.0)

- [x] **M45** ⭐ Outline sidebar (no TOC → no tab; live `remapped_toc`; scroll tracking) + Go to Page (Ctrl+G). The sidebar becomes a Pages | Outline switcher **only** for a TOC'd document (dock title "Sidebar"; the View-menu/toolbar toggle is renamed "Sidebar" — one stable label for both document kinds); TOC-less docs keep the bare Pages panel. Bundled fix: a reload-in-place now resyncs the file watcher, and a **closed** window can no longer raise the "file changed on disk" prompt (a lingering hidden window's stale watcher + a stray activation event = an unanswerable modal — it deadlocked the offscreen suite, and the pre-existing save-cancel path could trigger it too). — *WSL + WSLg* — [#117](https://github.com/utyagi24/klarpdf/pull/117)
- [x] **M46** Context menus everywhere — selection / link / empty-page / sidebar, hit-test routed.
  `PdfView.contextMenuEvent` delegates to a MainWindow-built menu by hit state: our annotation →
  Remove (the pre-M46 menu, now routed); live selection → Copy / **Highlight Selection** / **Redact
  Selection** (apply-now, vs the toolbar's armed one-shots); internal link → Go to Page N; **external
  link → Copy Link Address** (URI links stay non-clickable — clipboard only, offline guarantee
  intact); bare page → the routed View-menu QActions (fits · rotate · Go to Page). Sidebar menu adds
  Rotate Left/Right (extract joins at M51; paste-object at M59). — *WSLg* — [#118](https://github.com/utyagi24/klarpdf/pull/118)
- [x] **M47** Search-all results panel (page + snippet, click-to-jump; M64 reuses it). The FindBar
  gains a **List All** toggle → a hit-list band under the bar ("p. N   …snippet…"; hidden until
  asked — no dead chrome). Snippets are the hit's text line windowed ±4 words with ellipses; click
  a row → that hit becomes current and is revealed; the panel follows the query as typed, tracks
  next/prev, and empties with the overlay on a structural edit. — *WSLg* — [#119](https://github.com/utyagi24/klarpdf/pull/119)
- [x] **M48** Crop pages — `crop_override` on PageRef; page/selected/all scopes; "hidden, not
  removed" wording; reset offered. Rides the PageRef exactly like `rotation_override` (absolute
  content-frame rect; snapshots for undo; follows reorder **and** cross-window copy/paste);
  materialised via `set_cropbox`; live in the viewer (crop-aware geometry/overlay mapping + clip
  render + baked thumbnails). Armed **Crop Pages** drag → scope prompt (This/Selected/All) with the
  honesty wording; **Remove Crop** restores the full MediaBox — *including a crop the file arrived
  with* (pre-cropped sources also now display by their CropBox, fixing their layout). Odd/even
  book-scan crops stay deferred. — *WSL + WSLg* — [#120](https://github.com/utyagi24/klarpdf/pull/120)
- [x] **M49** Night reading mode (view-only pixmap invert). **View ▸ Night Reading Mode**
  (checkable, remembered app-wide): the page render inverts and the pre-render placeholder goes
  black (no bright flash); the file, print/export renders, and thumbnails keep true colours;
  independent of the followed OS theme. — *WSLg* — [#121](https://github.com/utyagi24/klarpdf/pull/121)
- [x] **R1 polish — the Tools menu** ([#123](https://github.com/utyagi24/klarpdf/pull/123); owner-decided during the stack review): the tranche's one
  budgeted top-level menu (`PLAN.md` §Design budgets) lands with the tools it was reserved for —
  Select/Grab and the armed one-shots (Text Box · Highlight · Redact ×2 · Crop + Remove Crop) move
  out of View into **Tools**; **Rotate Left/Right moves to Edit** beside the other page operations
  (it is a real, saved edit — the View placement implied a view-only spin). Shortcuts and the
  toolbar are unchanged; R3's Markup/Draw and R4's Stamp land straight into Tools.
- [x] **M50** Verify + release → tag **v0.12.0** (version bump + docs; 485 headless tests green on the
  merged main; local onedir build + smoke; CI draft → published) — *Windows* —
  [release](https://github.com/utyagi24/klarpdf/releases/tag/v0.12.0)

**R2 — "Document Hygiene"**

- [x] **M51** Extract selected pages → PDF + Insert blank / duplicate page — *Windows (headless + offscreen GUI)* — [#125](https://github.com/utyagi24/klarpdf/pull/125)
- [x] **M52** Reduce file size — Export ▸ Reduced Size PDF…; true-value presets + custom dpi/quality knobs; actual before→after — *Windows (headless + offscreen GUI)* — [#126](https://github.com/utyagi24/klarpdf/pull/126)
- [x] **M53** Properties + metadata (view · edit · remove; Info dict **and** XMP both) — *Windows (headless + offscreen GUI)* — [#127](https://github.com/utyagi24/klarpdf/pull/127)
- [x] **M54** ⭐ Document encryption — set/change/remove/carry-through, AES-256; optional advisory restriction flags — *Windows (headless + offscreen GUI)* — [#128](https://github.com/utyagi24/klarpdf/pull/128)
- [x] **M55** Verify + ~~release~~ tag — verify done (full headless suite green on merged main;
  owner validated the changes directly); **release cut skipped (owner call, 2026-07-19)** — main
  tagged **`v0.13.0`** only, so the version marks the R2 state without a published release. The
  CI draft the `v*` tag produces stays unpublished; R2's features first ship with the next
  published release. — *Windows*

**R3 — "Markup Tools"**

- [x] **M56** Underline & strikeout (Highlight's quad path; round-trip; Markup ▾ split-button) — *Windows (headless + offscreen GUI)* — [#130](https://github.com/utyagi24/klarpdf/pull/130)
- [x] **M57** ⭐ Pen & shapes model — ink/line+arrows/rect/ellipse descriptors, apply + read-back — *Windows (headless)* — [#131](https://github.com/utyagi24/klarpdf/pull/131) (shows **Closed**: merging #130 with `--delete-branch` removed this PR's *base* branch, which closes it irrecoverably; the commits reached `main` via #132, and the diff/review history is intact)
- [x] **M58** Pen & shapes tools — draw/move/delete, Shift-constrain, Draw ▾ split-button — *Windows (offscreen GUI)* — [#132](https://github.com/utyagi24/klarpdf/pull/132)
- [x] **M59** Copy / paste objects — object clipboard, cross-window, focus-routed Ctrl+C/X/V — *Windows (offscreen GUI)* — [#133](https://github.com/utyagi24/klarpdf/pull/133)
- [x] **M59.5** Markup colour · width · fill — shared sticky `MarkupStyle` + toolbar swatch button for underline/strikeout + pen & shapes — *Windows (headless + offscreen GUI)* — [#134](https://github.com/utyagi24/klarpdf/pull/134)
- [x] **M59.6** Multi-object selection — Objects mode: marquee + Ctrl-click; group restyle / move / delete (one undo each) — *Windows (offscreen GUI)* — [#135](https://github.com/utyagi24/klarpdf/pull/135)
- [x] **M59.7** Object resize — selection handles; single + group bounding-box resize (reusable placement component) — *Windows (headless + offscreen GUI)* — [#136](https://github.com/utyagi24/klarpdf/pull/136)
- [x] **M59.8** Object z-order — Bring to Front / Send to Back for a mark or group (paint + hit order) — *Windows (headless + offscreen GUI)* — [#137](https://github.com/utyagi24/klarpdf/pull/137)
- [x] **M59.9** Polish & fidelity — curated markup colour palettes (Markup ▾) · object opacity (`/CA`) · redaction preview z-order fix · edits keep your scroll place — *Windows (headless + offscreen GUI)* — [#138](https://github.com/utyagi24/klarpdf/pull/138)
- [x] **M59.10** Markup merge — re-marking text folds into the existing mark instead of stacking: same colour absorbs/extends, a different colour recolours what it covers and splits what it doesn't; one Remove, one undo step — *Windows (headless + offscreen GUI)* — [#139](https://github.com/utyagi24/klarpdf/pull/139)
- [x] **M59.11** Preview z-order fidelity — mark paint order follows the page's annotation tuple (not the mark's *type*), so a filled shape hides a text box's text as it does in the saved file, and the M59.8 z-order verbs restack the preview across types — *Windows (headless + offscreen GUI)* — [#140](https://github.com/utyagi24/klarpdf/pull/140)
- [x] **M59.12** Group copy / cut / paste — a multi-selection copies, cuts and pastes as a unit, keeping its arrangement (reverses M59.6's deferral, owner call); one undo step; labels count the set — *Windows (offscreen GUI)* — [#141](https://github.com/utyagi24/klarpdf/pull/141)
- [x] **M59.13** Dropdown-arrow placement — the Markup ▾ / Draw ▾ / style-swatch arrows all sit vertically centred with room from the icon, instead of Qt's two different per-popup-mode positions (one mid-height, one bottom-corner) — *Windows (offscreen GUI)* — [#142](https://github.com/utyagi24/klarpdf/pull/142)
- [x] **M60** Verify + release → **v0.14.0** tagged & published — *Windows*

**R4 — "Stamp, Sign & Watermark"**

- [x] **M61** ⭐ Unified content-draw engine (Way 2: presets = prefilled custom stamps; baked at save).
  `model/content_marks.py`: two descriptors — **`Stamp`** (text + optional rounded frame) and
  **`ImageStamp`** (a placed raster) — that ride the PageRef exactly like an annotation, but bake
  into the page's **content stream** at materialise instead of staying annotations. A **watermark is
  not a third type**: it is either of those with `under=True` (`overlay=False`, so the page's text
  sits on top), applied to every page in a range — the range is the UI's loop, not model state.
  Presets are **prefilled `Stamp`s**, so a placed preset is editable like a hand-made one and there
  is no second code path. Built **vector** (a throwaway one-page PDF placed via `show_pdf_page`)
  rather than the planned high-DPI pixmap: crisp at any zoom, stamp text stays searchable, and
  arbitrary rotation comes free — see `PLAN.md` §R4 "M61 as built". Because a content mark leaves
  nothing author-tagged to read back, a save that writes one is a **point of no return** like a
  redaction (`has_content_marks()` → confirm, write, reload from the clean file, or the next save
  would bake a second copy); the confirm now names which of the two it is committing. Move / resize
  / copy come from the existing `translate_mark` / `scale_mark` primitives. Print, export and live
  thumbnails inherit it via `render_output`. — *WSL (model+tests)* — 31 new tests, 767 green
- [x] **M62** Stamp & watermark UI — placement + dialogs + page-range apply. **There is no second
  placement system**: a content mark is a free-placed rect, so it joins `_OBJECT_TYPES` and inherits
  hit-testing, selection, move, corner-resize, z-order and delete from the M58/M59 object tools —
  which *is* the milestone's "drag rect, move, corner-resize until save", built by reuse. A new
  one-shot **`ArmedTool.STAMP`** shares the draw-gesture path (drag the box; Shift squares it).
  Two flows over the one engine: a **stamp / signature** is composed then *placed*, a **watermark**
  covers whole pages so it applies at once, sized to **each page's own** box. `ui/stamp_dialog.py`
  (text · colour · angle · opacity · frame · page range; presets prefill and stay editable) +
  `util/page_range.py` (`"1-3, 7, 12-"`, shared with M64's scope). Both dialogs state the bake
  boundary in the dialog. Toolbar: one new slot, the **Stamp ▾** split-button (three new icons).
  Live preview renders through the *same generator that bakes at save*; an `under=True` watermark is
  drawn with **multiply** compositing, since Qt cannot paint beneath the page pixmap — the page's
  text darkens through it exactly as in the saved file. — *Windows (headless + offscreen GUI)* —
  46 new tests, 812 green
- [x] **M63** Image stamp / signature — the sign-and-return workflow, on M62's placement UI.
  **"Make white background transparent"** (`white_to_alpha` + threshold) keys the paper out of a
  **phone photo** of a signature, which otherwise arrives as ink on an opaque white rectangle that
  blanks out whatever it covers; a transparent PNG still works through its own alpha, and existing
  alpha is **intersected, never replaced**, so keying can't resurrect pixels the author removed.
  Keying runs at C speed (MuPDF greyscale + one `bytes.translate`) because a 12-megapixel input is
  realistic. `ui/signature_dialog.py` previews through the *same generator that bakes at save*, so
  the threshold is judged on the real result. **Recent signatures store paths only** — KlarPDF keeps
  no copy of a signature image, and deleting the file is the revocation mechanism; the list hangs
  off Stamp ▾ (hidden until non-empty), making the second use **two clicks**, no dialog. Documented
  as ink-equivalent, **not** a cryptographic signature, in the dialog itself. — *Windows (headless +
  offscreen GUI)* — 21 new tests, 833 green
- [x] **M64** Search & redact — **Tools ▸ Find and Redact…**: mark-all → review → redact-checked.
  The dialog drives the **real** `SearchController`, so hits highlight on the page while they are
  reviewed in **M47's results panel, now checkable** — a doubtful row can be clicked to jump to it
  before deciding. Hits arrive **ticked but prunable** (the user asked for all of them, then
  prunes), and **Match case** / **Whole words only** exclude the classic false positive wholesale:
  MuPDF's `search_for` is always case-insensitive and always matches inside words, so both are
  filters over its hits — case compares the text under the box, whole-word is a *geometric* test
  that the touched words don't extend past the hit. **Nothing here is destructive**: checked hits
  become ordinary `Redaction` descriptors (one per page, all in one macro → one undo step) that the
  existing confirmed Save applies, so the app keeps exactly one destructive path. Honesty stated in
  the dialog: text-layer only, **image-only pages are detected and named**, form-field values are
  out of reach, and a box's width hints the removed string's length. — *Windows (headless +
  offscreen GUI, incl. the cross-engine Poppler leak check)* — 23 new tests, 856 green
- [ ] ~~**M65** Verify + release → tag~~ — **skipped by owner call (2026-07-20)**; R4's features
  ship with the next published release. Work continues at **R5 (M66)**.

**R5 — "Foreign Annotations & Form Fields"**

- [x] **M66** ⭐ Foreign-annot infra + delete — `model/foreign_annots.py`, the shared machinery M67
  and M68 consume. **Identity is the hard part**: an annotation's `xref` is renumbered by
  `insert_pdf`, so a descriptor holding one would target the wrong annotation at materialise;
  identity is instead the `/NM` name when the writing tool set one, else a hash of type + rect
  (rounded — a PDF float round-trip is not bit-exact) + contents, with identical twins resolved
  **positionally within the page**. `/NM` must be read from the **object dictionary** —
  `annot.info["name"]` is always empty, a trap that silently disables the preferred path (pinned by
  a test). First verb: **delete**, a `ForeignDeletion` riding the PageRef, applied to the
  materialised copy — so undo restores it, the shared source is never touched, and it works for
  **every** annotation type because it removes rather than rewrites. Fidelity is asserted on the
  surviving annotations' dictionaries **and appearance-stream bytes** (indirect references
  normalised — removing an object necessarily renumbers the rest). Viewer: hit-test + outline +
  right-click **Delete** / **Copy Comment Text**; a pending deletion is dropped from a per-*ordered-
  page* render copy, since a foreign mark lives in the page's own pixmap and no overlay can hide it.
  — *Windows (headless + offscreen GUI)* — 30 new tests, 886 green
- [x] **M67** Move foreign marks — drag any foreign annotation; a `ForeignMove` rides the PageRef
  and translates it at materialise. **The appearance stream is preserved verbatim** — a rich callout
  box moves with zero degradation because nothing re-renders it (asserted byte-for-byte). Not
  `Annot.set_rect`: on the quad-based text-markup types that **silently returns `False`** and leaves
  the rect alone, so a move built on it would fail invisibly on every highlight / underline /
  strikeout. Instead every geometry key in the annotation's dictionary (`/Rect`, `/QuadPoints`,
  `/Vertices`, `/L`, `/CL`, `/InkList`) is translated in place — all of them, or a highlight whose
  rect moved but whose quads didn't gets snapped back by any viewer that regenerates appearances.
  Deltas convert fitz's y-down to PDF's y-up. Fingerprints are **resolved once up front**, because a
  move changes the rect a hash fingerprint is derived from; deletion wins over a move for the same
  mark. Moves **combine rather than stack**, so one descriptor per mark always holds the original
  fingerprint; the viewer reports moved rects so hit-testing follows the mark you can see. — *Windows
  (headless + offscreen GUI)* — 24 new tests, 910 green
- [x] **M68** Adopt-on-edit — double-click a foreign mark of a **modeled type** (highlight ·
  underline · strikeout · ink · line · square · circle · FreeText) → it becomes an ordinary editable
  KlarPDF mark. The mechanism is **entirely M66's**: a `ForeignDeletion` of the original plus the
  parsed descriptor, one macro — so at materialise the original is stripped and ours is re-added
  author-tagged, and from then on it round-trips like a mark we drew. Parsing reuses
  `page_edits.parse_annotation` (extracted from `read_klarpdf_annotations`), so an adopted mark and a
  round-tripped one **cannot drift apart**. Unmodeled types (sticky note, stamp…) stay delete/move
  only and say so. **The degrade warning fires exactly when something would be lost** — rich text,
  a real callout, a reply thread, a dashed border, transparency on a type whose descriptor has no
  opacity field, a non-base-14 font. Getting "exactly" right was the work: `/RD` and `/CL` are
  written *routinely* by PyMuPDF itself, so naive key-presence warned on marks losing nothing, which
  is how a warning stops being read — a callout is now detected by `/IT /FreeTextCallout`, and `/RD`
  is ignored. A pending M67 move is folded into the adopted mark so it doesn't snap back. — *Windows
  (headless + offscreen GUI)* — 36 new tests, 946 green
- [x] **M69** Form-field creation — **Tools ▸ Add Form Field ▸ Text · Checkbox · Dropdown**: compose
  in a small properties dialog (type · name · default · choices), then drag the box with M62's
  placement gesture. `model/form_fields.py`'s `NewField` rides the PageRef and materialises via
  `page.add_widget`. **The output is not a KlarPDF construct** — it is an ordinary AcroForm field, so
  inline filling, lossless value save, edits-aware print and flatten all work on it *by construction*
  (each asserted by running the existing path over a created field, not new code). Creation runs
  **before** the fill pass, so a value typed into a field made in the same session persists; and
  `read_form_fields` reports placed-but-unsaved fields, so the form overlay tints one the moment it
  is drawn. The dialog requires a name (AcroForm keys values by name) and *warns without blocking*
  on a collision. **Radio groups stay rejected** (owner, 2026-07-18) — pinned by a test. — *Windows
  (headless + offscreen GUI)* — 29 new tests, 975 green
- [x] **M69.1** R4 stamp polish — four owner-reported items from the M61–M69 test pass, all in the
  stamp surface. **(1) A rotated mark baked as its own mirror image**: `show_pdf_page`'s `rotate` is
  clockwise-positive while `Stamp.angle`, the dialog spinner and the viewer preview are all
  counter-clockwise, so a −45° stamp tilted one way on the page and the other in the thumbnail —
  which renders the bake, and therefore the saved file. Every watermark shipped so far had its
  documented "bottom-left to top-right" diagonal backwards. **(2) A stamp had no Copy/Cut/z-order on
  its right-click menu**, though it selected, moved, resized and Ctrl+C/X/V'd fine: the menu carried
  a hand-written type list that predated the R4 content marks. It now reads
  `viewer.annotations.OBJECT_TYPES`, and the Remove verb defers to `mark_noun` instead of falling
  back to "Remove annotation". **(3) Stamp lettering could only be sized by resizing the box**, which
  auto-fit turns into a fight with the padding (a 260×100pt box fits "APPROVED" at 44.5pt on *width*,
  leaving 39pt of vertical slack you can only close by making the box narrower). The dialog now has a
  **Size** field — "Fit to box" (the unchanged default) or a point size — and a pinned size makes the
  box hug the text via `content_marks.natural_size`, so a **click** places it and there is no padding
  to fight. A resize carries the pinned size along (smaller axis governs) so the hug survives.
  **(4) The composed stamp/watermark style is now sticky across sessions** through `Settings`
  prefs — text, colour, size, angle, opacity, frame. The **page range is deliberately not
  remembered**: it is the one field where a stale value is destructive.
  **(5) A pinned size now means the size that is drawn**, which the first cut of (3) did not
  deliver. `render_mark_document` built the artwork at the *rect* size, so `show_pdf_page` — which
  fits rotated artwork into its rect — silently rescaled it: **120pt at −45° baked at 40pt**, in a
  box 89pt wider than A4 that could not be centred, with the artwork sitting diagonally inside a
  rect shaped for horizontal text (the reported "resizing distorts the stamp"). Artwork size and
  rect are now separate concerns — `art_size` / `placement_size` / `art_scale` / `art_target_rect`
  — so a pinned mark is placed at its **rotated extent** and baked at scale 1, is never enlarged to
  fill a roomier rect (still shrunk rather than allowed to spill), and `size_for_page` reduces a
  size too large for the paper to the largest that fits so it can be centred. A resize re-derives
  the box from the new size instead of stretching it, so the hug is exact at every step. The
  viewer's preview reads the same `art_scale` the bake applies, so the two cannot drift.
  — *Windows (headless + offscreen GUI)* — 45 new tests, 1020 green
- [x] **M69.2** Watermark interaction + live-thumbnail fixes — two owner-reported defects, neither
  watermark-specific underneath. **(1) Text selection stopped working on a watermarked page**: a
  full-page mark was an ordinary object hit target, so a press *anywhere* grabbed it before text
  selection got a look in (the armed markup tools were unaffected, which is exactly how it presented
  — "highlight and underline work, but selecting text does not"). A mark that blankets the page is
  no longer an interaction target for move / select / marquee; it stays reachable by right-click,
  which offers **Remove watermark** and drops the object verbs that would do nothing to it.
  **(2) Thumbnails did not update**: `populate()` runs on every edit and reset *every* row to a blank
  grey placeholder, re-rendering only the rows in the viewport — so one edit emptied the sidebar and
  most rows stayed empty until scrolled to. Rows now carry their previous render (a structural edit
  carries nothing, since row N is then a different page). Compounding it, a range apply called
  `_note_edit_on` per page, scrolling the view — and the sidebar — to the **last** page of the range;
  it now follows the first. — *Windows (headless + offscreen GUI)* — 11 new tests, 1031 green (1029 after the M69.3 merge folded two dialogs into one)
- [x] **M69.3** ⭐ Stamp and watermark merged into one feature — owner call: *"given the similarity
  I am not seeing much value offering them as two separate features"*. They were never two: the model
  has only `Stamp` / `ImageStamp` and a watermark is one with `under=True`. Of the seven axes on
  which the two dialogs differed, **six were defaults** and exactly one was structural — **how the
  mark is placed**. So `ui/mark_dialog.py` replaces both dialogs with one carrying a **Place**
  control ("Where I drag it" / "Over the whole page") that rewrites the style fields visibly and
  hides Size + Frame for a page-covering mark; `Tools ▸ Stamp / Watermark…` replaces the two menu
  entries. Presets became **one list of words** (`MARK_PRESETS`) prefilling text + colour only —
  ending the collision where "Draft" and "Confidential" sat in *both* lists meaning different
  things. Rationale and the Way-2 argument in `PLAN.md` §R4. Done before R4's first release, while
  it was still free. — *Windows (headless + offscreen GUI)* — 1029 green
- [x] **M69.4** Large-document mark performance — owner-reported: watermarking all pages of a
  **320-page** document left the app sluggish *afterwards*, not just during. Measured on
  `spaceX_prospectus.pdf`: the apply took **10.6s**, and **every subsequent edit cost 10.7s**. Two
  causes, both O(document) where they should be O(what's on screen). **(1) The overlay rasterised
  every content mark in the document on every repaint** — 320 marks to display about two. Content
  marks are the one overlay built by rendering a real PDF rather than from cheap Qt items, and the
  page pixmaps had been lazy since M25 while the overlay never caught up; they now share the view's
  prefetch band (`content_band`) and paint incrementally as pages scroll in (incrementally, not by
  `repaint`, which would drop the object selection on every scroll tick). **(2) The auto-fit search
  was uncached** — `_fit_fontsize` runs a 14-step binary search, each step opening a throwaway PDF
  and embedding a font, so one repaint ran ~4,500 of them to compute the *same* answer 320 times.
  Memoised on its scalar inputs, which fully determine the result. **Apply 10.6s → 0.93s; a later
  edit 10.7s → 0.89s; `view.reload()` 8.8s → 0.16s.** The remaining per-edit cost is the thumbnail
  panel's whole-document `render_output` bake (0.69s of the 0.89s) — see Open follow-ups.
  — *Windows (headless + offscreen GUI)* — 5 new tests, 1034 green
- [x] **M69.5** Whole-page marks: visible by default, and they stop moving the reader — two more
  owner-reported items. **(1) "Behind the page content" produced nothing.** Reported as *"does not
  update the thumbnails, does not save with the document"* — but the mark **was** saved: on
  `spaceX_prospectus.pdf` the watermark's text is in the saved page's text layer and is simply
  **invisible**, because `under=True` puts it beneath *everything the page draws* and most real
  PDFs paint an opaque full-page background. The on-screen preview hid the problem by compositing
  with **multiply on top**, which shows regardless — so the preview and the file genuinely disagreed
  (the M62 code comment claimed they were equivalent; that only holds for a page with a transparent
  background). Whole-page marks now default to **over** the content, which at watermark opacity is
  what a watermark should look like anyway — visible, with the page's own text fully legible
  through it. `under` is unchanged as a capability and still offered, with a tooltip that says when
  it will disappear. Making `under` itself honest is in Open follow-ups. **(2) The current page
  jumped** to the first or last page when marking the whole document. `_note_edit_on` exists to
  follow a mark to the page it landed on; a **range** mark did not land anywhere in particular, so
  it is no longer called for one — marking every page changes nothing about where the reader is.
  — *Windows (headless + offscreen GUI)* — 4 new tests, 1038 green
- [x] **M69.6** "Behind the page content" removed from the UI — owner call: *"I don't see any value
  for under given that we have opacity control in place already."* M69.5 had defaulted it off and
  warned in a tooltip; this drops the control. `Stamp.under` stays an **engine** capability (the M61
  "one engine, over or under" design and its tests are untouched) — the UI simply stops offering a
  control whose ordinary outcome is *nothing appears*, which is worse than dead chrome. The
  previously-recorded fix (bake `under` as an over-content `/BM /Multiply` draw so the file matches
  the multiply-composited preview) was **rejected**: it would not restore the one thing true
  under-print uniquely gives — page images *covering* the mark — and it means hand-built
  `/ExtGState` PDF code in the **save path**, adding exactly the cross-renderer variability that
  §M61's "no cross-renderer calibration" owner call exists to avoid. A pre-M69.6 settings file
  carrying `"under": true` is ignored rather than resurrecting the mode. — *Windows (headless +
  offscreen GUI)* — 1038 green
- [x] **M69.7** Two use cases, two controls — owner call: *"There are basically two use cases…
  so we don't need the third option of dragging to stamp."* Dragging a rectangle was only ever a way
  of **sizing** a text stamp; once a point size is on the dialog it is a second answer to a question
  already answered, and the worse one — a dragged box sets the size only indirectly, through the
  padding auto-fit leaves (which is what M69.1 was reported about). `Kind` is now *Stamp (click to
  place)* or *Watermark (whole page)*; the size field drops its "Fit to box" position and defaults to
  36pt; a stamp is centred on the **press point**, not the middle of a stray drag, and draws no
  rubber band to advertise a box it will not take. **Signature/image placement and M69 field
  creation keep the drag** — neither has a font size, so the box is genuinely how you size them, and
  `fontsize=0` stays the engine's auto-fit sentinel under them. — *Windows (headless + offscreen
  GUI)* — 5 new tests, 1042 green
- [x] **M69.8** Angle slider — owner request. The angle keeps its spin box and gains a slider
  beside it: two views of **one** value (the slider to find a tilt by eye, the spin box to say one
  exactly), synced without either driving the other in a loop. Ticks at the quarter turns plus a 3°
  snap to them, because 0° and ±45° are most of the angles anyone wants and exactly the ones a free
  drag over a −180…180 range is least likely to land on; the snap is short enough that a deliberate
  38° still sticks. Degrees are whole now, so the two views cannot disagree. — *Windows (headless +
  offscreen GUI)* — 5 new tests, 1047 green
- [x] **M69.9** Angle sign corrected + one shape for every numeric row — two owner items.
  **(1) The angle sign was backwards.** `Stamp.angle` was clockwise-positive — `-45` gave the
  north-east diagonal — while the field's own docstring said counter-clockwise and the watermark
  default was written `-45` with the comment "bottom-left to top-right". The owner asked the obvious
  question (*"shouldn't north-east be +45?"*); it should, so the **descriptor** was corrected rather
  than the docs bent to fit it. `+45` is now north-east, `-45` south-east. That cancelled the
  negation `apply_content_marks` had carried since M69.1 and added one in the preview (Qt's
  `setRotation` is clockwise-positive in a y-down scene). Free to fix: R4 has never shipped.
  **(2) Angle and Opacity are one shape.** They had drifted into two layouts — a slider stacked over
  a read-only label, and a slider beside an arrow-spinner — which is what made the dialog read as
  cluttered. Both are now `_SliderField`: a slider plus a typable, **spinner-free** value box, built
  once so the rows are identical by construction rather than by care. The box is a spin box with its
  buttons hidden, not a line edit, which keeps range clamping and number parsing for free.
  — *Windows (headless + offscreen GUI)* — 1047 green
- [x] **M69.10** Mark dialog geometry warning — owner-reported: switching Kind logged
  `QWindowsWindow::setGeometry: Unable to set geometry … Resulting geometry: …` on every switch. Qt
  was promising Windows a minimum **48px shorter** than the layout then needed. Cause: the wrapped
  bake note under the form. A word-wrapped `QLabel`'s height is a function of its **width**, which
  `minimumSizeHint` does not consult — so a dialog narrow enough for the note to re-wrap taller
  advertised a minimum it could not actually live in, and showing/hiding the Size + Frame rows made
  Qt ask for a geometry the platform then had to override. Fixed by pinning the note's minimum
  height to what it needs at the dialog's narrowest allowed width, giving the dialog that width
  floor, and resizing deliberately on a Kind switch instead of leaving the window manager to infer
  it. Cosmetic (a console warning, nothing misrendered) but it was the layout genuinely fighting
  itself. Nothing to do with the document being edited — dialog geometry only.
  — *Windows (headless + offscreen GUI)* — 3 new tests, 1050 green
- [ ] **M70** Verify + release → tag — *Windows*

## Public-Release Readiness — go open-source under AGPL-3.0 (planned)

**The repo is public** as of **2026-07-17**, as an `AGPL-3.0-or-later` project — the flip (G8) is done.
**G1–G5, G7 and G8 are complete; `G6 Part 2` (enrol in GitHub Sponsors) is the only item left**, and
nothing depends on it. Independent of the v0.11.0 MCP roadmap — this track landed first. Full
execution detail in `PLAN.md` §Public-release readiness (plan introduced in
[#83](https://github.com/utyagi24/pdfproj/pull/83)). **One PR per item**; tick the box on merge and
append the PR link. Steps were ordered — **G1 ran first, while the repo was still private**, and the
flip itself was a manual GitHub action, not a PR. The pre-public hygiene scan was clean (no secrets in
tree or history; `.gitignore` excludes build artifacts/wheels/`report.json`; CI uses `${{ secrets.* }}`).

- [x] **G1** Commit-author cleanup (**done** — history rewrite, no PR) — `git filter-repo` mailmap
  remapped the maintainer's personal email (162 commits) **and** the older bare-form no-reply (80
  web-commit authors) onto the canonical `<id>+username@users.noreply.github.com`, author + committer;
  content byte-identical (trees unchanged); `main` + all 15 release tags force-pushed; verified **0**
  personal-email / bare-form authors remaining and all Releases intact. Done first, while private. — *WSL/Windows*
- [x] **G2** Branding — name + logo (**done** — all three parts). **Decision gate: closed.** The product is **KlarPDF** (*klar* =
  "clear" in German / the Scandinavian languages); `pdfproj` was the dev codename. An earlier pick,
  *sheaf*, was dropped for clashing with existing GitHub PDF-processing projects — the marks were drawn
  under that name, hence the design-source title in `assets/brand/BRAND.md`. Name mapping: display
  string **`KlarPDF`** (window title, About, installer AppName) · drawn wordmark lowercase `klarpdf`
  (BRAND.md §Type) · repo + exe + `%LOCALAPPDATA%` leaf + single-instance id `klarpdf` · ProgID
  `KlarPDF.Document`.
  - [x] **Part 1 — visual assets** — toolbar glyph set (24 replaced + 3 new: `about`, `donate`,
    `export`), app mark, regenerated `packaging/klarpdf.ico`, and `assets/brand/` (tokens + `BRAND.md`
    + icon spec). No code changes; icon filenames unchanged. — *WSL* —
    [#91](https://github.com/utyagi24/pdfproj/pull/91)
  - [x] **Part 2 — the name sweep** — app strings (`app.py`, window title, `platform_integration.py`
    single-instance id, `store/settings.py` `%LOCALAPPDATA%` leaf); `PDFPROJ_AUTHOR` → `KLARPDF_AUTHOR`
    with the tag **value** `klarpdf`, and its five `*_klarpdf_annotations` helpers; asset filenames
    (`klarpdf.svg` / `.ico` / `.spec`); `installer.iss` AppName/Publisher/ProgID + **a fresh `AppId`
    GUID**; `build.ps1`, `release.yml`, `pyproject.toml`, `tasks.py`, tests, docs. **No back-compat
    shims**: the app has never been distributed (single user), so the settings dir and the annotation
    tag change outright rather than carrying a migration. The fresh `AppId` stops Inno treating the
    renamed setup as an in-place upgrade (which would skip the old uninstaller's registry +
    config-dir cleanup and reuse its install dir) — **uninstall `pdfproj` before installing
    `KlarPDF`** (`RELEASE.md`). Historical release notes, shipped artifact names and repo URLs are
    left as-is: they record what actually shipped. — *WSL* — [#92](https://github.com/utyagi24/pdfproj/pull/92)
  - [x] **Part 3 — GitHub repo rename** (**manual**) — `gh repo rename klarpdf` (**not**
    `gh repo edit --rename`, which doesn't exist), run while the repo was still private.
    `utyagi24/pdfproj` → `utyagi24/klarpdf`; GitHub redirects the old URLs, so the historical
    release/PR links above keep resolving, and PRs/issues/releases are untouched (a *repo* rename is
    safe — it is a *branch* rename that closes an open PR, see #86). Re-pointing each checkout's
    `origin` is **optional** — GitHub redirects the old remote over **both** HTTPS and SSH — but if you
    do it, **keep the checkout's existing protocol**: the Windows checkout is HTTPS
    (`https://github.com/utyagi24/klarpdf.git`), the WSL checkout is SSH
    (`git@github.com:utyagi24/klarpdf.git`). Rewriting an SSH remote to the HTTPS form makes git ignore
    `~/.ssh/config` and start prompting for a password that cannot work (password auth was removed in
    2021). Local working-directory names deliberately keep the old codename. — *GitHub*

  Feeds the copyright name (G3), the About name+logo (G4), and the community files (G5).
- [x] **G3** License + notices — root `LICENSE` (full AGPL-3.0-or-later) + `THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES`
  (PyMuPDF AGPL-3.0, PySide6 + shiboken6 LGPL-3.0, pypdf BSD-3; cross-ref `DEPENDENCIES.md`) +
  README license section + badge + build-from-source pointer (uses the G2 name) — *WSL* — [#95](https://github.com/utyagi24/klarpdf/pull/95)
- [x] **G4** In-app About + Open-Source Licenses dialog — Help menu (`main_window.py`) → **About**
  (mark + version + AGPL + the AGPL §15-16 no-warranty notice + a *tagged* corresponding-source link,
  never `main`), **Open-Source Licenses** (the bundled texts, one tab each, offline), **View Source**.
  New `ui/about.py` (dialogs) + `util/resources.py` (freeze-aware `resource_path()`, mirroring
  `ui/icons.py`'s `_MEIPASS` dance); `packaging/klarpdf.spec` `datas` ships `LICENSE` +
  `THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES` to the bundle root. Links open via `QDesktopServices` on **user click only**,
  so the offline / no-telemetry guarantee holds. `tests/test_about_dialog.py` drives the real Help
  menu and simulates `sys._MEIPASS` — the frozen path the headless suite otherwise never executes —
  and asserts the spec still bundles both texts, since a `datas` regression is invisible to CI.
  — *WSL + WSLg* — [#97](https://github.com/utyagi24/klarpdf/pull/97)
- [x] **G5** Community-health files — `SECURITY.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`
  (Contributor Covenant), `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/*` + `pull_request_template.md`
  — *WSL* — [#96](https://github.com/utyagi24/klarpdf/pull/96)
- [x] **G5.1** Governance — **open source, closed to PRs** (decided after G5 landed; rationale in
  `PLAN.md` §Public-release readiness). **Issues open to everyone** (bugs / security / feature
  requests); **PRs restricted to the maintainer + invited collaborators**, others auto-closed by
  `.github/workflows/close-external-prs.yml` (`pull_request_target`, *no* checkout — that trigger runs
  with write access, so it must never execute a fork's code). DCO 1.1 is now **deemed accepted** on
  submission: no `Signed-off-by`, no CI check — G5 had claimed unsigned PRs "cannot be merged", which
  nothing enforced. **Open decision:** the DCO grants no rights, so the *first* merged contribution by
  anyone other than the maintainer — a collaborator included — forecloses commercial relicensing
  (PLAN.md's Artifex hatch). A CLA or explicit relicensing grant must be settled **before** a
  collaborator's first merge. **Repo settings (manual):** keep Issues **on**; enable private
  vulnerability reporting; Wiki/Projects/Discussions off; **no interaction limits** (they would block
  the public from opening issues, defeating the policy). — *WSL + GitHub settings* —
  [#98](https://github.com/utyagi24/klarpdf/pull/98)
- [ ] **G6** Donations — repo + product — let users support the project. **Platform: GitHub Sponsors**
  (decision gate closed) — same host as the source link, so supporting the project introduces no
  third-party domain into the app or the repo. Open-source + donations is fully AGPL-compatible.
  - [x] **Part 1 — the code** — `.github/FUNDING.yml` (`github: utyagi24`); README **Support** section
    + Sponsor badge; **Help ▸ Donate…** (extends the G4 Help menu, grouped with *View Source* — the
    separator splits "opens a dialog" from "hands a URL to the browser") + an About-dialog link, both
    via `QDesktopServices.openUrl` on **user click only, so the offline / no-telemetry guarantee holds**
    (the app opens no socket itself). A test asserts `FUNDING.yml` and `ui/about.py` name the *same*
    account — see the trap below. — *WSL + WSLg* — [#107](https://github.com/utyagi24/klarpdf/pull/107)
  - [ ] **Part 2 — enrol the account in GitHub Sponsors (manual; the actual gate)** — Stripe +
    identity + GitHub review, so it takes **days**, not minutes: start it early. Verify with
    `gh api graphql -f query='{user(login:"utyagi24"){hasSponsorsListing}}'` → currently **`false`**.
    **The trap:** `https://github.com/sponsors/utyagi24` does **not** 404 without a listing — GitHub
    silently **redirects it to the plain profile page**, so a dead Donate link is indistinguishable
    from a working one, in the app and in CI. Nothing automated can catch this; hence the one-time
    gate in `RELEASE.md` §3, to be checked before the first release that ships the menu item.
    **This is now the only thing standing between the project and a finished public-release track**
    (G1–G5, G7, G8 all done). Two consequences of that ordering, both live today:
    - the in-app **Help ▸ Donate…** and About link **already shipped** in v0.10.0, so they currently
      lead to a silent redirect to the plain profile — harmless, but wrong;
    - the repo **Sponsor button** (the check moved here from G8) needs the repo public — ✅ since
      2026-07-17 — *and* the listing. So the listing is now the sole remaining blocker for it.
    Verify both once enrolled: `hasSponsorsListing` → `true`, and the Sponsor button renders on the
    repo page. — *GitHub account*
- [x] **G7** Lock-in identity, hygiene & branch rulesets — keeps the G1 scrub true, permanently. Three
  parts: repo-side (one PR), manual identity, and the ruleset. The ruleset was *decided and
  pre-authored* here and **completed at G8**, where its premise turned out to be wrong: G7 recorded
  that a ruleset *cannot exist* while private (a 403 on `GET .../rulesets`), but two were already
  active — the 403 was the **API**, not the rulesets. See Part 3 and G8.
  - [x] **Part 1 — repo side** — `.gitignore` gains `*.pfx *.pem *.key .env *.log` (nothing matches
    today; `*.pfx` is the live one — Authenticode signing is a carried follow-up and a cert lands in the
    tree as exactly that). New `.github/workflows/author-email-guard.yml` fails a PR whose author (or
    committer) email is not a GitHub no-reply — the backstop under the local `user.email` and the
    account-level push block, both of which are per-machine/per-account state a fresh clone or a new
    machine silently loses. `test.yml` loses the `paths-ignore` on its **`pull_request`** trigger and
    gains an in-job docs-only gate, so the `pytest` check reports on every PR without running the suite
    on markdown — the prerequisite for requiring it below (rationale + the two-workflow trap it avoids:
    `PLAN.md` §Public-release readiness). — *WSL* — [#106](https://github.com/utyagi24/klarpdf/pull/106)
  - [x] **Part 2 — identity (manual, per machine + account)** — **all four verified.** `git config
    user.email` = the no-reply on **both** checkouts: **Windows** (local + global =
    `12071588+utyagi24@…`) and **WSL** (owner-verified — the two checkouts are bridged only by git, so
    each is its own machine). GitHub account ▸ Emails: **Keep my email addresses private** ✅ +
    **Block command line pushes that expose my email** ✅ (owner-verified in the UI — the first needs a
    `user` API scope this checkout's `gh` lacks, the second has **no API at all**, so neither is
    machine-checkable from here; the public profile `email` field now reads empty, which is consistent).
    With the push block on, the *server* now rejects an exposing push — Part 1's `emails` workflow
    remains the backstop for what these per-machine/per-account settings cannot cover (a fresh clone,
    a new machine, a changed account).
  - [x] **Part 3 — the `main` ruleset, decided + pre-authored** (**reconciled** at G8 — see the
    correction there). Payload lives at [`.github/rulesets/main.json`](.github/rulesets/main.json)
    with the rationale beside it, so the rules are reviewable in a diff rather than clicks made once
    in the UI. In short: **block force-push** + **restrict deletions** + **require the `pytest` and
    `emails` checks**, **empty bypass list**; *require review* dropped while solo (G5.1), *linear
    history* rejected (the project merges with merge commits), *signed commits* deferred (unsigned
    today; needs GPG/SSH for the no-reply identity first). Full rule-by-rule reasoning: `PLAN.md`
    §Public-release readiness. **This part's premise was wrong, corrected at G8:** it recorded that a
    ruleset *cannot exist* before the flip, from `GET /repos/utyagi24/klarpdf/rulesets` → **403
    "Upgrade to GitHub Pro or make this repository public"**. The 403 was about the **API**, not the
    rulesets — two were already active. — *WSL* — [#107](https://github.com/utyagi24/klarpdf/pull/107)
- [x] **G8** Flip to public (**manual; not a PR**) — **done 2026-07-17. The repo is public.**
  (`gh repo edit --visibility public --accept-visibility-change-consequences`; the second flag is
  **required**, `gh` refuses `--visibility` without it.) Every item in G8's own scope is complete and
  verified; the Sponsors-listing check that used to sit here is G6's and moved there. Docs landed in
  [#111](https://github.com/utyagi24/klarpdf/pull/111) + [#112](https://github.com/utyagi24/klarpdf/pull/112)
  — the settings themselves are not a PR.
  - [x] **Private vulnerability reporting** — enabled; `GET
    repos/utyagi24/klarpdf/private-vulnerability-reporting` → `{"enabled": true}`. Flip-gated (404s on
    a private repo — public-repo-only). Until it was on, `/security/advisories/new` 404'd — and that
    URL is the *only* reporting channel `SECURITY.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`,
    `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/config.yml` and the auto-close workflow's comment advertise.
  - [x] **Secret scanning + push protection** — both `enabled`. Also flip-gated (they need paid GHAS
    while private; free once public).
  - [x] **Dependabot security updates** — `enabled` (`PUT repos/utyagi24/klarpdf/automated-security-fixes`).
    **Not in the original G8 list**; added here because it is free on a public repo and is the
    mechanical version of the pypdf advisory (**GHSA-jm82-fx9c-mx94**) that was caught by hand in
    v0.9.4. See Open follow-ups.
  - [x] **The `main` ruleset — reconciled, not created.** G7's premise was **wrong**: it recorded that
    rulesets cannot exist before the flip (`GET .../rulesets` → 403 *"Upgrade to GitHub Pro or make
    this repository public"*). That 403 was the **API** being unavailable on a private free repo, not
    an absent ruleset — **"Protect Main"** (id 18233952) and **"Protect Tags"** (id 18234032) had been
    active since **2026-06-28**. So `deletion` + `non_fast_forward` were already in place and the only
    rule G8 actually added was **`required_status_checks`: `pytest` + `emails`**, `PUT` into the
    existing ruleset rather than `POST`ed as a second overlapping one. Its pre-existing `pull_request`
    rule (0 approvals) was **kept** — it enforces `CLAUDE.md`'s "never leave edits on `main`", and G7
    only ever meant to decline required *reviews*. `main.json` is now a **mirror** of the live
    ruleset. Verify: `gh api repos/utyagi24/klarpdf/rulesets/18233952 --jq '.rules'`.
    **Likely-but-unconfirmed:** a private free repo *creates* rulesets without *enforcing* them (it
    fits the 403, and G1's force-push succeeding weeks after `non_fast_forward` was listed) — so `main`
    plausibly acquired real protection only at the flip. `PLAN.md` §Public-release readiness.
  - [x] **The two dynamic README badges went live** — verified: `tests: passing`, `release: v0.10.1`.
    They read the GitHub API, so while private they rendered *"repo or workflow not found"* and
    *"inaccessible"*; the flip fixed both with no edit.
  - ~~Add repo description/topics~~ — **done ahead of the flip** (needs no public repo): description
    set + 13 topics. Nothing to do here at G8.
  - [x] **Upload the social preview** (**manual — the one G8 step a human had to click**; there is no
    REST API for it) — Settings ▸ General ▸ Social preview ▸ `assets/brand/social-preview.png`.
    **Done + verified**: the repo's `og:image` meta now resolves to `repository-images.
    githubusercontent.com` (a custom upload; the default would be `opengraph.githubassets.com`) and the
    served bytes are **sha256-identical** to `assets/brand/social-preview.png`, 1280×640. This is what
    renders when the repo link is pasted anywhere. Re-check with:
    `curl -sL https://github.com/utyagi24/klarpdf | grep 'og:image'`.
  - ~~Check the Sponsors listing is live~~ — **moved to G6 Part 2**, where it belongs: it verifies
    *G6's* deliverable, and was only parked here because the Sponsor button also needs a public repo
    — a condition now permanently satisfied. Leaving it here would make G8's status a lagging shadow
    of G6's, which is exactly the duplication `CLAUDE.md` §"update in exactly one place" forbids. — *GitHub*

## Open follow-ups (carried)

Carried items — none block work:

- **The thumbnail sidebar bakes the *whole document* on every edit.** `ThumbnailPanel._edited_render`
  calls `PyMuPDFEngine.render_output(vdoc)` — a full materialise of every page — so the panel can
  rasterise the handful of thumbnails actually on screen. On a 320-page document that is **~0.69s per
  edit** (measured at M69.4 on `spaceX_prospectus.pdf`, after the mark-rendering fixes took the rest
  of the edit cost from 10.7s to 0.89s); it is now the single largest remaining O(document) cost per
  edit, and it grows with page count on *every* edit, not just marks. The fix is a **per-page bake**:
  an engine entry point that materialises only the pages asked for, which the panel would call for
  its visible rows the same way `_render_visible_thumbs` already scopes rasterising. Deferred because
  it touches the shared `render_output` path that print and save also use, so it wants its own
  milestone and its own verification rather than riding a bug-fix branch. Not a blocker: 0.89s per
  edit on a 320-page document is responsive, and small documents are unaffected.

- **Upstream PyMuPDF bug: URI links with an unbalanced paren are dropped by `insert_pdf` /
  `insert_link`** (unescaped re-serialisation of the URI text; console shows "skipping bad link /
  annot item N"; seen in the wild in a novaPDF-produced file whose URI is `http://www.adobe.com)`).
  Worked around in `model/links_remap.py`: the materialise link pass re-adds any URI link
  `insert_pdf` dropped, with the text pre-escaped (round-trips correctly). Consider reporting
  upstream to PyMuPDF; if fixed there, the restore pass simply finds nothing missing.

- **A stale `vendor/wheels/` silently shadows the lock in `-Offline` builds.** Found while building
  v0.10.0: the local cache still held `pypdf-6.13.2` (the wheel the v0.9.4 security bump replaced), so
  `build.ps1 -Offline` failed with *"Could not find a version that satisfies pypdf==6.13.3"*. The repo
  was correct (`requirements-win.txt`, `vendor/wheels-sources.md` both say 6.13.3); `vendor/wheels/` is
  **gitignored**, so it drifts per-machine and never gets re-vendored by a `git pull`. CI is unaffected
  (it fetches fresh). Fix by re-running `build.ps1` **without** `-Offline` once, then re-running with
  it. Worth a guard in `build.ps1` that diffs the cache against the lock before an offline build.
- **Flaky test: `test_single_instance.py::test_handoff_opens_window_in_resident_instance`.** Failed
  once, passed on rerun (timing-sensitive Windows IPC: a race between the resident instance binding its
  socket and the forwarding launch connecting). **Could not reproduce** — 5 isolated runs + several
  full suites all green. **Stakes rose twice at G8** and this is now the most actionable follow-up:
  the repo is public, so a flake is a red X on a stranger's first CI run — *and* `pytest` is now a
  **required status check**, so a flake no longer merely looks bad, it **blocks the merge** until
  someone re-runs the job. (The bypass list is empty by design, so there is no override; the escape is
  re-running the check, or flipping `enforcement` to `disabled` and back.) Note the check runs on
  `ubuntu-latest` while the observed flake was on Windows.
- **Dependency vuln: pypdf → 6.13.3** → ✅ fixed in **v0.9.4**: bumped `pypdf` 6.13.2 → 6.13.3
  (**GHSA-jm82-fx9c-mx94**, Moderate memory-DoS in the `pypdf` fallback edit engine), recompiled the
  locks + regenerated `vendor/wheels-sources.md`, and removed the audit-gate ignore.
- **Clean-machine install** — the one deferred M9 verification item: run `klarpdf-setup-x64.exe` on a
  Windows VM with **no Python and networking disabled** (Win10 Home has no Sandbox → VirtualBox /
  spare machine / fresh local user). Everything else in the Verification matrix is green.
- **CI action versions** → ✅ done in M15: `actions/checkout@v6`, `setup-python@v6`,
  `upload-artifact@v7`, `softprops/action-gh-release@v3` (all Node-24).
- **Code signing** — deferred Authenticode step (removes the SmartScreen prompt); needs a cert, so
  it stays deferred (still unsigned through v0.4.0); slots into `release.yml` before packaging
  (PLAN.md §Packaging §5). Carry to a future release once a cert is available.
- **App icon** → ✅ shipped in **M10** (v0.2.0).
- **Product features** → view/print/annotate/redact/round-trip/flatten-export all shipped (M0–M31.5).
  The next tranche is **scheduled** in §Next roadmap above: image import/export (v0.8.0, M35–M37);
  encrypted PDFs + GoTo-link remap (v0.9.0, M32/M33, re-scoped out of v0.7.0).
  Still **deferred beyond** the roadmap (PLAN.md §Future enhancements): new-field form designer,
  drop-to-open in the main view, re-encryption on save, cross-app annotation editing (M31 round-trip
  edits only KlarPDF's own author-tagged marks; foreign annotations are shown but not editable — a
  deliberate fidelity-safety boundary, see PLAN.md).

- **Help ▸ Donate… points at a GitHub Sponsors listing that does not exist.**
  `gh api graphql -f query='{user(login:"utyagi24"){hasSponsorsListing}}'` returns **false**, and
  `/sponsors/utyagi24` **redirects to the plain profile** rather than 404ing — so the dead link is
  indistinguishable from a working one and no test can catch it. This is exactly the one-time gate
  in `RELEASE.md` §3, which was **not** satisfied before v0.12.0 shipped the menu item, nor before
  v0.14.0. Owner call at v0.14.0: **ship as-is, fix separately.** Clearing it is a GitHub account
  step (enable the Sponsors listing), after which the gate check returns true and the gate block can
  be deleted from `RELEASE.md`.

- **Flaky test: the save path's `os.replace` hits `[WinError 5] Access is denied`.** Seen twice
  while preparing v0.14.0, both times in `tests/test_external_change.py` (different tests each
  time: `test_save_no_external_change_does_not_prompt`, then `test_save_overwrite_proceeds`), and
  only in **full-suite** runs — the file passed 4/4 in isolation, and a clean full re-run was green
  both times. `_write_to` writes a temp file next to the target then `os.replace`s it, so a
  transient lock on the freshly written temp (real-time antivirus is the usual suspect on this
  machine) fails the rename; the resulting "Save failed" modal is what the conftest guard reports.
  Environmental rather than a code defect, but it is a **release-gate** annoyance and shares the
  "red X on a stranger's CI run" stakes with the single-instance flake above. Worth a bounded
  retry around the `os.replace` before declaring the save failed.

- **`MarkupStyleButton.style()` shadows `QWidget.style()`** (it returns the `MarkupStyle`
  dataclass). Harmless in paint — Qt calls the C++ method — but any Python-level `button.style()`
  gets the wrong object, and it already cost one debugging detour in M59.13 (workaround:
  `QWidget.style(btn)`). Rename to `markup_style()` when that file is next touched.
